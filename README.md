# Descritpion of this Repository

In creating this form, I aimed to provide a practical example of how GDPR obligations could be technically implemented in the front-end layer of a web application. To ensure compliance with GDPR, particularly the principles of data protection by design and by default, I have implemented AES encryption algorithm to encrypt the sensitive data, and I saved the secret key used for encryption as an environmental variable. I also included a consent checkbox, requiring users to agree to the terms and conditions before submitting the form.

In order to follow best practices during web development, I saved the secret key used for encryption as an environmental variable and ignored it in .gitignore. This provides an extra layer of security, ensuring the key remains secure and is not accidentally committed to a public repository.

Furthermore, I have implemented an additional layer of security by sending the data to the server using HTTPS. This ensures that the data is protected from unauthorized access during transmission.

Overall, this form is an example of how web developers can implement GDPR compliance in the front-end layer of a web application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
